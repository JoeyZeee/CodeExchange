# CodeExchange
Coding Social Media WEBSITE:

Every 24-hours, you are asked to upload a piece of code that is then given for review to a random person of the same skill level (determined by EXP), who then edits your code. When they are finished, an automatic discussion is published where you can view the feedback they gave you on your code. You can then mark that as a solution, or comment on that post, both giving you and the person who gave feedback EXP. Premium memberships allow you to upload as much code as you would like, as well as the ability to review other people's code as much as you would like. You also get a tag next to your name so everyone knows you are a premium member on this site.
